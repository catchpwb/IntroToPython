In your class, many students are friends. Letâ€™s assume that two students sharing
a friend must be friends themselves; in other words, if students 0 and 1 are friends and
students 1 and 2 are friends, then students 0 and 2 must be friends. Using this rule, we can
partition the students into circles of friends.
To do this, implement a function networks() that takes two input arguments. The first
is the number n of students in the class. We assume students are identified using integers
0 through n-1. The second input argument is a list of tuple objects that define friends.
For example, tuple (0,2) defines students 0 and 2 as friends. Function networks() should
print the partition of students into circles of friends as illustrated:
>>> networks(5, [(0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4)])
Social network 0 is {0, 1, 2}
Social network 1 is {3, 4}

    for n in range(len(listTuples)-1):
