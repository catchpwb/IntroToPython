Write function pay() that takes as input an hourly wage and the number of hours an
employee worked in the last week. The function should compute and return the employeeâ€™s
pay. Overtime work should be paid in this way: Any hours beyond 40 but less than or equal
60 should be paid at 1.5 times the regular hourly wage. Any hours beyond 60 should be
paid at 2 times the regular hourly wage

        pay += 40 * wage
    elif (60 < numHours):
