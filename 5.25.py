Implement function leap() that takes one input argument—a year—and returns
True if the year is a leap year and False otherwise. (A year is a leap year if it is divisible by
4 but not by 100, unless it is divisible by 400 in which case it is a leap year. For example,
1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years but 1600 and 2000 are.)
